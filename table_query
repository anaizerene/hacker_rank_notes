anytime a question states "QUERY ALL" use the asterisk (*) to generate a randomized, or wildcard, list.


the difference between SELECT and SELECT DISTINCT is that SELECT is general pull from a dataset, while SELECT DISTINCT will pull only items that are distict from another. 
for example, let us say you have a dataset of human names from the United States, living or dead. You will most likely come across duplicates like several "John Adams" or 
"Mary Evans". Let us say you only want to pull people who share the same last name "Adams" but you do not one a whole bunch of "John Adams" in your query. 
Using the SELECT DISTINCT prompt, it will only pull those who share user_lname "Adams" that are distinct from each other, meaning each person's first name is completely different. 
This is what we want.
